#summary Using NRobotRemote and RIDE

= Introduction =

RIDE (Robot IDE) is a GUI for creating robot framework test cases. One of its main features is _keyword completion_, allowing you to design tests without referencing lots of documentation. Further information on RIDE is available [https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE here]

This page details how .Net keyword libraries can be used with RIDE.

= Details =

RIDE cannot directly interrogate a .Net keyword library to find what keywords are available in it. However a "Library Spec" file can be given to RIDE.

== Generating a Library Spec File ==

A library spec file is created using the robot framework libdoc tool. To use this tool with NRobotRemote:

  * Start NRobotRemote with your keyword library and xml documentation
  * Execute libdoc pointing it to NRobotRemote host and port number, and create an xml file

Example:

<code>
java -jar robotframework-2.8.1.jar libdoc --name TestLib Remote::localhost:8271/mytype TestLib.xml
</code>

== Giving RIDE the Library Spec File ==

Once the library spec xml file is created by _libdoc_ it has to be passed to RIDE. Details of this can be found [https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/wiki/Keyword-Completion#wiki-using-library-specs here]
