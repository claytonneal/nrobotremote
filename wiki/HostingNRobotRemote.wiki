#summary How to host NRobotRemote in own application

= Hosting NRobotRemote =

NRobotRemote is designed as an asynchronous component that can be hosted in any application. Infact NRobotRemoteConsole.exe is no more than a console host for the NRobotRemote component.

The following example shows how to start the NRobotRemote service.

<code language="c#">

RemoteService srv = new RemoteService(options.library,options.type,options.port,options.docfile);
srv.StartAsync();
Console.ReadLine();
srv.Stop();

</code>

*NOTES*

  * The docfile parameter is optional
  * Two background threads are started when _StartAsync_ is called, one thread to listen for HTTP requests, and the other to process HTTP requests.
