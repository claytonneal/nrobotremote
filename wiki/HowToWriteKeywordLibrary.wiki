#summary How to write a keyword library

= How To Write a Keyword Library =

Writing a keyword library is very simple.Create a new class library project in C#/Vb.net and add a _public_ class to the project. All public _instance_ methods of the class with:

  * Return type = void
  * Return type = String
  * No parameters
  * All parameters of type String

Will be considered as keywords.
*Note* _Static_ methods are not considered as keywords.

=== Example ===

The following class exposes three keyword methods

<code language="c#">
public class MyKeywordClass
{
   
   public void DoAction()
   {
      ...
   }

   public String DoOperation(String arg1, String arg2)
   {
      ...
   }

   public void Do_Task(string arg1)
   {
      ...
   }

}
</code>

The following keywords can be used by robot framework

  * DOACTION
  * DOOPERATION
  * DO TASK
  
=== General Notes ===

  * It is not possible to overload the same keyword method. For a method to be considered a keyword it must have only one implementation.

=== Keyword Names ===

When a keyword such as "DO TASK" is used in a robot framework script, NRobotRemote will try to find a corresponding method with name "do_task". i.e. Spaces are replaced with underscores.
 
=== FAQ ===

*Is it possible for the keyword class to maintain state?*<br/>
Yes, only one instance of the keyword class is created for the duration of the service.
